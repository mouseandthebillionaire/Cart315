# CART 315: Game Prototyping – Winter 2025 – 3 credits

Thursdays, 17:45 – 21:45 in EV 5.615
Instructor: Matthew Bethancourt | [matthew.bethancourt@concordia.ca](mailto:matthew.bethancourt@concordia.ca)

## [Territorial acknowledgment](https://www.concordia.ca/about/indigenous/territorial-acknowledgement.html)

We acknowledge that Concordia University is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien’kehá:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather today. Tiohtiá:ke/Montreal is historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.

## Description

Students study specialized game technology, create a series of digital game prototypes, and are introduced to higher level programming concepts pertaining to interactive applications. Efficient approaches to the design and development of complex interactive software, such as iterative development and rapid prototyping, are explored.

This class will take you through the pre-production and development of a series of game prototypes building up to a final game project, using the Unity game engine and the C# language. This will require continuous iterative development and testing, and therefore students will be evaluated on their progress every week.

Prerequisite: CART 263 or COMP 218 or COMP 248; or written permission of the Department.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

* Use rapid prototyping and iterative design methods to design and develop a game from beginning to end.
* Learn basic programming skills and game development concepts using C# and the Unity Engine
* Run effective playtests and incorporate playtesting feedback into your design process.
* Plan development to mitigate risks and meet deadlines autonomously

## Course Materials

* [Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development](https://concordiauniversity.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1340042737) by [Jeremy Gibson Bond](https://book.prototools.net/)
* [Unity Version 6 (6000.0.xx LTS)](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive)
* [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) (which you can get a free student license for) or another code editor 
* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or a git client you are familiar with
* The [Discord](https://discord.com/) Client

## Assignments and Class Structure

This course will be an organic mix of lecture and practice with the professor working to explain the concepts, give examples, and oversee how well students grasp the ideas discussed as they work on assigned projects. There will be multiple game prototypes that build up to one final major project. Students will also keep a design journal through GitHub that includes corresponding documentation of design ideas, prototype exploration, and reflections. We will use this material for informal presentation and critiques which will occur weekly throughout the term.

### Prep Materials

Each week I will assign readings/videos/activities that must be done *before* the class sessions. Not all material will be discussed in class every week, but it lays the foundation for what we will accomplish during our time together.

### Class Sessions

Each class will begin with a discussion period in the classroom. I will answer questions about about the week's material and build example prototypes based on what we have covered so far. Additional topics for discussion will be introduced as necessary. 

### Studio time

The second half of some sessions will be studio time for you to work on exercises/projects and get any assistance and/or feedback as needed.

Attendance of the studio period is technically optional, but students are *very heavily encouraged* to take the time to connect with the instructor and to work in the group setting.

## Weekly Prototypes and Process Documentation via GitHub

Every week you will make something to test a design idea. You will use GitHub to save, track, and present this and all other coursework. We will be using the [MDM Framework](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdm) for tracking progress and changes in both the design thinking and execution of your work. Each week I will select students to informally talk through their most recent design sprint in front of the class for feedback. These weekly design journals will be graded and make up the majority of the available points for this course.

### Final Project

As we reach the end of the semester the weekly prototypes will solidify into a final idea, with each new prototype scaffolding on the ones before. These prototypes will increase in complexity and refinement, as every week you work through a complete design cycle of ideation, prototyping, testing, and refinement.

## Course Website

You're looking at it! I will post most things here (including details on lecture schedules, readings, examples, assignments, etc.). The course [Moodle](https://moodle.concordia.ca/) will mainly be used for posting grades.

## Evaluation

	* Exploration Prototypes (4) 
	* Iterative Prototypes (5) 
	* Final Documentation (1)
- Participation (12%)
* Final Game (13%)
## Accessibility & Inclusion

Please do not hesitate to contact me to bring up any issue related to accessibility, or if you require any accommodations in order to participate - whether that is because of disability, interactions with other students, work or child-care responsibilities, trauma, or any other reason.

## Academic Integrity

Game development frequently involves a lot of code reuse. Whenever you reuse or build on someone else’s code, you are expected to appropriately credit and reference its authors. The same is true of imagery, sounds, video, excerpts of literature, art works, and contributions from other students. Failure to do so may be regarded as plagiarism. Importantly, the university doesn’t care about intentions when it comes to plagiarism.
