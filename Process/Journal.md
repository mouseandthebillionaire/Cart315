# Weekly Class Journal

## Notes for Class 4

Some reflections on tonight's sessions:
* I am beginning to wonder if it was a mistake to remove the weekly reading quizzes from the material. Having an external reason to do the readings/videos may be important. We want to learn, but other things get in the way, obviously, and it may be important o have that _thing_ over our head to remind us to prioritize. And maybe that idea of prioritizing is the key here. If there is no consequence for not doing the reading (other than having a weaker understanding of the material, obviously) then we naturally lower it on our level of priorities.
* Talking through the design/developer roadmap for the game seemed to work well. I will do this again for the shmup in week 5.
* It may benefit the class to push back the debugging practicum. I'm not convinced that we have spent enough time in Unity looking at the error codes to be able to do this successfully 
* It will take some time, but it's probably a good idea to link to *everything* within the markdown files. Primarily I am thinking currently about the design journal assignment in the schedule linking to the one in the projects.md file. 

## Notes for Class 3

Switching to a asynchronous class session today leads to some interesting observations:
* the term "asynchronous" implies that the work will be done not at the same time, but I am still on call during those hours
* I suppose those students who want to do the work on (say) Friday, can do it asynchronously, but are not able to lean on me for help if that is the case.
* For the future it would make more sense to announce this work with enough time that students could do it outside of class, and then come to the class session with questions if they have them. (obviously this was harder to do with the unfolding nature of the student strikes, but good to know for future sessions)
* I wonder if there is some level of hand-holding that is important here. Or, an even better way of thinking about it, creating space. The class session is a place to create space for everyone to work on the thing that needs to be accomplished, similar to how we need to proactively create space for reading, meditation, reflection, etc or it won't happen. Does the asynchronous session break this?

## Notes for Class 2

Overall, a good class session today. The playtesting of the games seemed to go well. Lots of enthusiasm and people were able to play multiple of their colleagues colleagues. Some notes:
* bring in the [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket) for those students who want to see what their GBStudio looks like on some (quasi) original hardware.
* There's something to be said for absolutely no playtesting intro, but maybe some sort of context might work better in the future? Either way is an interesting approach.

The studio portion of the class also went well but over-time and there are a few thoughts that I had about improving things in the future:
* obviously GitHub setup was a huge issue. The main fix for this when working on the computer lab computers is to set up the repos in github *before* beginning the Unity projects. PB sent his ["how to github"](https://pippinbarr.com/cart253/topics/software/github-repository.html) documentation, which does the same thing
* of note, GitHub's Unity .gitignore file wasn't working to actually ignore any files, which is insane. Double-check this next time.
* It's probably a good idea to present a workflow (plan & perhaps pseudo-code) of what we are going to cover that day in the project (i.e make a controller, have it move side to side, create a falling object, etc) That way, more advanced students can charge ahead with building the thing without having to wait for the next step

As far as the project (Falling Asleep) and the next stage (Pong), I'm wondering if it might be more fun to build something that *isn't* Pong? Pong is great and all (and rather sticky) but I've done it so many times before. Kind of boring! Think through something that might use the same additions to the base project (second player, physics, scores, text display, sounds) but leads to more innovative gameplay.

I think that's all the thoughts for this week. Moving on!
