### Design Journal
- Exploration Prototype 2 - Using the material that we looked at this week (physics, object tags, scoring, sound, etc) experiment with a game prototype and then document the exploration. What is your idea? What are you trying to test? What did you learn? Was it successful? Where might you go next if you wanted to keep exploring this idea? If you are stuck, think about how you could change some of these things to make an experimental version of the Pawng game we created. For instance, what happens if some of the object attributes change over time? Or every time the ball bounces?
