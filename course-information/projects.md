# Assignments

## Limited scope introduction project: Make a Thing!

For the first week of class you will be introduced to a variety of accessible game-making tools and given one week to work on a limited scope project. You will present this on the second week of class.

## Design Journal

Your design journal is a living document in your repo that will contain your thoughts and reflections throughout the process of prototying your games. Generally this encompasses discussing the design goals for the current idea, what you made to test those ideas, what your take away from the prototype was, and what you intend to accomplish next. Most weeks there will be an additional prompt to help guide the explorations that you should be pursuing. 

**Due: Weekly**

## Final Project

Once you have explored a few possible directions with your prototypes, you will settle on a final idea that you would like to refine. The remaining weeks of the course will be dedicated to prototyping this idea into a final version. This will go through a traditional iterative game design process, where we weekly step forward and loop through:

* Ideation
* Prototyping
* Testing
* Refinement

**Due: April 10*
