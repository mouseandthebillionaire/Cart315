### Design Journal
- Exploration Prototype 2 - Using the material that we looked at this week (physics, object tags, scoring, sound, etc) experiment with a game prototype and then document the exploration. What is your idea? What are you trying to test? What did you learn? Was it successful? Where might you go next if you wanted to keep exploring this idea? If you are stuck, think about how you could change some of these things to make an experimental version of the Pawng game we created. For instance, what happens if some of the object attributes change over time? Or every time the ball bounces?

* Design Journal: Iterative Prototyping 1 (Conceptualizing) - Journal about your ideation process. Include any Design Values, Precedents, and your 3 favourite ideas. These don't have to be very detailed, just a few sentences to capture the main game concept. Build out simple prototype to test one of the ideas. This can be a role, look/feel, or implementation prototype (Remember that this doesn't have to be digital!)
