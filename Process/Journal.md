# Weekly Class Journal

## Notes for Class 1 (01.16.25)

Other than the power going out and needing to end the session early, this felt like a good start to the semester. I am slightly nervous that the lack of introduction to the software (bitsy/pico-8 especially) will be detrimental to the projects that we will see next week, but I think the language of "we are having you make-a-thing not because it's going to be a good thing but rather _specifically_ to try and get your first bad thing out of the way" is a good way of talking about it. It helps with scope, too, obviously, but it might be more important to "rip the band-aid off."

Looking forward to this semester!

## Notes before the 2025 Semester

Based on the ideas of "why do we evaluate the *game* rather than the designer/developer" this semester of the course will focus more heavily on the MDM process, specifically on documenting the students' design thinking. Additionally, instead of formal presentations at the end of the semester (or for specific milestones), I am planing on calling on students at random throughout the semester to talk through what they have documented from the week before. Hopefully this will:
	a) encourage students to stay on top of their documenting
	b) be a better platform for actually discussing the _prototyping_ work that has been done, and
	c) improve the overall level of the documentation, since students will be seeing their colleagues versions of documentation weekly

Fingers crossed!

## Notes for Make-Up Class (04.17)

Looking back (i.e grading) these Process Journals it becomes obvious that there needs to be more accountability (i.e hand-holding) to make sure that it is a) done correctly, and b) done at all.
### An idea _Presents_ itself (pun intended)
Presentations might not be worthwhile, but what about casual weekly presenting of process. There would probably not be enough time to go through _all_ of the process journals, BUT what if we randomly selected a few? What if it was a game!? This could work to a) keep everyone on their toes b) discuss the good/bad issues that could then be applied each week.

## Notes for Class 9

Question (based on a revelation I had while speaking in front of the class today): If this class is a "prototyping" class, then the evaluations should evaluate prototyping. We do these game design / development classes, and then we evaluate the *game* rather than the designer/developer. 

## Notes for Class 8

Somehow we're already on week 8? The student strike seems to have really thrown a bit of a wrench in the effectiveness of this class this semester. Though really once you get the whole notion of:
- pose a question
- build an iteration/prototype to answer the question
- test
- reflect and journal about the process
there isn't a lot of hand-holding / face-time that *needs* to happen. But it's still nice. A few students came in to the Discord for the class to ask some questions, but they are definitely in the "how do I?" vs. the "how *would* I?" camp.

Which brings up the notion of how to best communicate the overall idea of the prototype. *how do I* VS. *how should/would I* is actually kind of compelling, but there's probably even better ways to get the students in the mindset of testing whether a given idea has legs. Something to keep mulling over!

## Notes for Class 4

Some reflections on tonight's sessions:
* I am beginning to wonder if it was a mistake to remove the weekly reading quizzes from the material. Having an external reason to do the readings/videos may be important. We want to learn, but other things get in the way, obviously, and it may be important o have that _thing_ over our head to remind us to prioritize. And maybe that idea of prioritizing is the key here. If there is no consequence for not doing the reading (other than having a weaker understanding of the material, obviously) then we naturally lower it on our level of priorities.
* Talking through the design/developer roadmap for the game seemed to work well. I will do this again for the shmup in week 5.
* It may benefit the class to push back the debugging practicum. I'm not convinced that we have spent enough time in Unity looking at the error codes to be able to do this successfully 
* It will take some time, but it's probably a good idea to link to *everything* within the markdown files. Primarily I am thinking currently about the design journal assignment in the schedule linking to the one in the projects.md file. 

## Notes for Class 3

Switching to a asynchronous class session today leads to some interesting observations:
* the term "asynchronous" implies that the work will be done not at the same time, but I am still on call during those hours
* I suppose those students who want to do the work on (say) Friday, can do it asynchronously, but are not able to lean on me for help if that is the case.
* For the future it would make more sense to announce this work with enough time that students could do it outside of class, and then come to the class session with questions if they have them. (obviously this was harder to do with the unfolding nature of the student strikes, but good to know for future sessions)
* I wonder if there is some level of hand-holding that is important here. Or, an even better way of thinking about it, creating space. The class session is a place to create space for everyone to work on the thing that needs to be accomplished, similar to how we need to proactively create space for reading, meditation, reflection, etc or it won't happen. Does the asynchronous session break this?

## Notes for Class 2

Overall, a good class session today. The playtesting of the games seemed to go well. Lots of enthusiasm and people were able to play multiple of their colleagues colleagues. Some notes:
* bring in the [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket) for those students who want to see what their GBStudio looks like on some (quasi) original hardware.
* There's something to be said for absolutely no playtesting intro, but maybe some sort of context might work better in the future? Either way is an interesting approach.

The studio portion of the class also went well but over-time and there are a few thoughts that I had about improving things in the future:
* obviously GitHub setup was a huge issue. The main fix for this when working on the computer lab computers is to set up the repos in github *before* beginning the Unity projects. PB sent his ["how to github"](https://pippinbarr.com/cart253/topics/software/github-repository.html) documentation, which does the same thing
* of note, GitHub's Unity .gitignore file wasn't working to actually ignore any files, which is insane. Double-check this next time.
* It's probably a good idea to present a workflow (plan & perhaps pseudo-code) of what we are going to cover that day in the project (i.e make a controller, have it move side to side, create a falling object, etc) That way, more advanced students can charge ahead with building the thing without having to wait for the next step

As far as the project (Falling Asleep) and the next stage (Pong), I'm wondering if it might be more fun to build something that *isn't* Pong? Pong is great and all (and rather sticky) but I've done it so many times before. Kind of boring! Think through something that might use the same additions to the base project (second player, physics, scores, text display, sounds) but leads to more innovative gameplay.

I think that's all the thoughts for this week. Moving on!
