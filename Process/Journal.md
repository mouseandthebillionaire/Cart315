## Notes for Class 2

Overall, a good class session today. The playtesting of the games seemed to go well. Lots of enthusiasm and people were able to play multiple of their colleagues colleagues. Some notes:
* bring in the [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket) for those students who want to see what their GBStudio looks like on some (quasi) original hardware.
* There's something to be said for absolutely no playtesting intro, but maybe some sort of context might work better in the future? Either way is an interesting approach.

The studio portion of the class also went well but over-time and there are a few thoughts that I had about improving things in the future:
* obviously GitHub setup was a huge issue. The main fix for this when working on the computer lab computers is to set up the repos in github *before* beginning the Unity projects. PB sent his ["how to github"](https://pippinbarr.com/cart253/topics/software/github-repository.html) documentation, which does the same thing
* of note, GitHub's Unity .gitignore file wasn't working to actually ignore any files, which is insane. Double-check this next time.
* It's probably a good idea to present a workflow (plan & perhaps pseudo-code) of what we are going to cover that day in the project (i.e make a controller, have it move side to side, create a falling object, etc) That way, more advanced students can charge ahead with building the thing without having to wait for the next step

As far as the project (Falling Asleep) and the next stage (Pong), I'm wondering if it might be more fun to build something that *isn't* Pong? Pong is great and all (and rather sticky) but I've done it so many times before. Kind of boring! Think through something that might use the same additions to the base project (second player, physics, scores, text display, sounds) but leads to more innovative gameplay.

I think that's all the thoughts for this week. Moving on!
